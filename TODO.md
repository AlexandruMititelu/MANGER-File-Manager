<h1>TODO</h1>

- Add icon when the file is running
- Installer ( <it>Alex</it> I was thinking of INNO), that sets up the directory where a .json file for last input, so you don t lose the SOURCE and TARGET Folder everytime you open the app again, yet it is hidden from the user
- Installer also runs pyinstall, so that exe for all systems (Windows, Mac, Linux) are created
    - Setup Docker for Mac and Linux
